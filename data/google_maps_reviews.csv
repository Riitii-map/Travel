The contemporary architecture, a harmonious blend of steel and glass, now exudes an air of spaciousness and modernity. The revitalized food court further enhances the passenger experience.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNULTlqUTRRRRAB,Airport Terminal 1 Indira Gandhi International,2,Anjali raj urs,"An airport of any city is very often the first and last impression you have of a city. In some sense it reflects the ethos of the city you are leaving and that of those who run, and subsequently represent it. I honestly can't understand what the hoopla is all about at IGI Terminal 1. Very unsavoury experience. The entire section with the food court is without AC and the day we landed it was a scorching 43 degrees. When it comes to the departure gates, the ratio of seats to passengers is 1:9 easily. I understand that they're refurbishing but isn't there a shred of humanity? They could have provided makeshift chairs for people. They could have had mobile coolers in the spaces that are not air-conditioned. I had to have my kids sit on the floor. It astounds me that they have space that they've reserved for couches that can have one person lolling around in a huge space while kids, senior citizens who didn't manage to reserve a spot in advance are just standing around. What really broke my heart was that there was a lady with a little infant sitting on the floor as he slept. Etiquette and manners cascade and there's no one with an iota of consideration in this ""celebrated"" airport at the National Capital to teach the same to the people who frequent it. The actual boarding was a prime example in chaos. With haphazard organization, there were passengers running helter skelter to converge on this one bottleneck.
Even on the day we landed our flight was taxiing around for half an hour and then another half hour just to get an airstair. There were people with connections scrambling to get to the next leg of their journey.
Have been in some really tiny airports where airport staff and the general demeanour and functioning left us with much better impressions than this one. And airport management might want to keep in mind that we don't burn holes in our pockets to have stress-filled travel.
The entire episode made us really glad we were on our way out and not in!",11 months ago

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMa2Q3TjNBRRAB,Airport Terminal 1 Indira Gandhi International,1,Mohammad IDrees Jalal,"Frequently, an airport serves as both your initial and final impression of a city. It is reflective of the culture of the city you are leaving behind as well as the people who govern and hence represent it, in a way. To be honest, I don't know what all the excitement is about at IGI Terminal 1. An extremely unpleasant experience. It was a sweltering 47 degrees on the day we arrived, and the entire area around the food court is without air conditioning.

The ratio of seats to passengers at the departure gates is easily 1:6. We know they're renovating, but isn't there at least a semblance of humanity? They could have given people temporary chairs. In the areas without air conditioning, they may have used portable coolers. The youngsters had to sit on the floor for me. I find it astounding that they have couches set out for one person to lounge on while children and elderly people who were unable to secure a spot ahead of time are left to stand around.
The fact that a mother was sitting her small child on the floor as he slept truly broke my heart. Manners and etiquette flow naturally, and nobody in this ""celebrated"" airport in the nation's capital seems to care enough to impart the same values to the passengers who use it. The actual boarding was a perfect illustration of disorder. Passengers were rushing haphazardly to congregate at this one bottleneck due to poor organization.
Even on the day of our landing, we spent 30 minutes taxiing around and an additional 30 minutes waiting for an airstair.
Some with connections were rushing to continue on to the next part of their adventure.

We've traveled to several incredibly small airports where the personnel, overall operation, and general attitude left us with far better impressions than this one. Additionally, airport management should remember that we don't burn through money for stressful travel.

We were so relieved to be leaving rather than entering during the entire show!",10 months ago

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaG9hZHJ3RRAB,Airport Terminal 1 Indira Gandhi International,4,BricksandRoof Realestate,"Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi has two terminals, Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. Terminal 1 is used for domestic flights within India and is known for its basic facilities and limited space. It has been reported that the terminal is often overcrowded and lacks sufficient seating areas for passengers.

However, the airport authority has taken steps to improve the facilities and services offered at Terminal 1, such as modernizing the check-in process and providing better security measures.

Expect long and disorganized crowd everywhere.   Had multiple bad experience earlier too so try to avoid this terminal but there are some instance where no option available so have to go with it.
This terminal  had already crossed its maximum capacity and precovid building work of new T1 building started and till the new terminal is completed this old T1 will operates with reduced capacity still more than its reduced capacity as much area is closed for operation.
When you reach the terminal 1st queue starts from entry gate, I can understand CISF checking of ticket and ID is for our safety but it should be little fast and smooth, many gates remains unmanned and long queue at operating gate.
Then you enter and proceed to check in desk, this depends upon airlines but what I experienced in recent  days there are hardly any support staff of airlines at check in area to manage crowd and many people were jumping queue at last moment.
Then comes the most important (but unfortunately most mis managed) part which is security, very few check point operating with respect to crowd and very congested area  to stand before, no chance of maintaining social distancing and after evert few passenger have to call airport staff for tray, and bonus every fourth fifth person is so called late and have to jump the queue, sometime queue is so long that it can easily go till airline check in counter.
After security  anyone proceed to have some food at food court/stand alone restaurant or lounge or directly to boarding gate.
Due to renovation food court is closed (saw they constructing new one at ground floor) so crowd at whatever places remains.
There is only one lounge that is Encalm lounge ,the lounge itself is good but due to over crowding again expect a queue.
After that time to board the flight and boarding area is another crowded area.very few place to sit with respect to crowd also the airport consider it self as silent airport so no announcement ,in this situation cant stay away far from gate even if no place to sit.
Don't know what is the concept of silent airport ,there are lots of different sound through out the airport but can't do flight announcement .

The moment I stepped into the terminal, I was struck by its sleek and modern design. The spacious interiors, high ceilings, and abundance of natural light make for a truly welcoming atmosphere. The terminal's architecture is a beautiful blend of Indian culture and contemporary style, with intricate patterns and motifs adorning the walls and ceilings.

The check-in and baggage drop process was seamless and efficient, with plenty of counters and friendly staff to assist. The security checks were also quick and hassle-free, with multiple scanners and courteous personnel.

One of the standout features of T2 is its incredible art installations and exhibits. The terminal is home to an impressive collection of Indian art and artifacts, including stunning sculptures, paintings, and textiles. The displays are beautifully curated and add a unique cultural dimension to the airport experience.

The food and beverage options at T2 are also excellent, with a wide range of Indian and international cuisine available. From traditional street food to fine dining restaurants, there's something for every taste and budget.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to add more seating areas and power outlets, as the terminal can get quite busy during peak travel times.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRZ2V5RC1nRRAB,Airport Terminal 3 Indira Gandhi International,3,Frank Lim,"Station is a perfect microcosm of what india is and is not:

+
1.) cheap tickets. Eg to get to city centre is <1‚Ç¨ in about an hour.
2.) metro trains every ~10' during peak times.
3.) station platform digital boards showing live train arrival timings.

-
4.) for volume of passengers, very narrow train doors. Need to be much bigger to manage volume of passengers. But stations are not temp controlled well (or at all?) so perhaps this design choice was a concession to that?
5.) poor cleanliness. As you see the guy who'll likely be pushing around a broom on the station ticketing level or platform level, look around and up and you'll see all the accumulated grime/grit/cobwebs & many non-operational lights which go uncleaned and unfixed. Why?
6.) the people are uncouth. The passengers I mean. They'll push past you and cut in the security line, they'll not keep the left (or right) to allow other to pass on the escalators. In spite of markings to indicate where to give way to alighting passengers, they crowd platform doors and push their way on immediately.
7.) ticketing for non-reloadable card/infrequent users of the metro is a pain. You must cue at one of three ticketing desks to purchase a paper qr code ticket in cash only. Cannot use a mobile app to purchase. Not a machine inside the station. Cannot use any card payment.

It's too bad to see the clogged roads, world-class poor air quality mostly from all their vehicles, and a lightly/moderately used metro running this frequently. If India/Delhi cared, they would do more and different. Could be worse I guess (see usa).",a month ago

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdkxYVnN3RRAB,Airport Terminal 3 Indira Gandhi International,3,mac san,"Recently I landed up to pick up someone from terminal 3 arrival and was shocked to know we couldn‚Äôt take our cars in for a quick pickup using the 5minute stoppage time . We were directed to the parking area to park our vehicle as we were told that road was closed now. We were told we could utilise a free 25minute parking time (same as before).
Earlier we used to park our cars some 10minutes away while coordinating with our passenger but this time we had to quickly park the car and walk superfast to the arrival gates and then turn back with them to again take the car out.
When you get down the ramp to exit lane (where fast tags also exist) but it does take a bit of time are cars move slowly and there is no way to check whether you have stayed in for 25minutes or more.
Anyway this was a domestic arrival and the next day i came for an international arrival and parking made sense.
Post parking I waited outside gate 5 arrival. Emirates landed around 0227hrs and my relative who had a u.s passport  had to stay in immigrations queue for an hour despite it being a business class q.
He came out at 0340hrs. So guys at that time its quite a wait.
Anyway I tool a few photos to help out us fellow travellers.
So basically best thing is to tell your arrival before hand to find your outside either gate 4,5,6 (6 is better )
You can wait either outside your gate or sit in the eateries next to gate 6.
They have a few working heaters around this area which is a nice addition
If coming alone with no pickup the meru and mega cab counters are right in front of gate 5 and 6.They are more expensive than uber and ola but they are right outside and cars come in a jiffy.
If you prefer an ola or uber you will need to walk right down to the right from gate exit and at the end turn left and straight to the end.
If you want the traffic police monitored regular cabs they are right behind pillar 15 outside gate 5&6.
Same walk which is about 5-8 minutes is used when we pickup guests now.
In front of gate 5 there are two buggies free of cost for senior citizens and ladies with infants.
As far as city buses and other buses are concerned you need to move from gate 5 or six and move to the left.
Earlier punjab roadways had arranged for their ac coaches which were reasonably priced to pick u up from same area but apparently due political reasons the airport guys moved them to some 2kms away to public transport centre which can be connected with airport free coach near gate 3 or 4.
If you have to go to terminal 2 just exit outside gate 6 and turn a slight left and some 100 ft away you can see a covered walkway. Just walk and you will be there in some 5minutes.
Toilets are just before this walkway

A few suggestions for the airport management.
1) Do allow cars to pickup their passengers but before that maybe you need to widen the arrival area . After all you have so much space and though a cost the flyover can be widened.
2) If possible and if not a security issue you can perhaps use immigration cameras and duty free area cameras to beam to a few large screens outside so that pickup team can maybe able to see the progress of their arrivals .
3) allow punjab roadways cheaper ac buses a subsidised space to an area close to the other bus pickup and not so far away in public transport centre.
Airport is not all about making money.
4) For arrival passengers enable auto connect to wifi if they have connected earlier so that connecting with their families is quick",2 years ago

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiMnZfUnpnRRAB,Airport Terminal 3 Indira Gandhi International,4,Anurag Bahadur,"I recently traveled from the departure side of IGI Airport, New Delhi, and overall, it was a positive experience. The airport is well-maintained with good internal air conditioning, ensuring a comfortable atmosphere for travelers.

One aspect to keep in mind is the drop area traffic. The drop zone can get quite busy, so it's wise to plan accordingly to avoid any delays. The boarding gates, especially those like 42A, can be a bit confusing. Clearer signage would be helpful for a smoother navigation experience.

The food facilities at the airport are commendable. I ordered Chole Bhature with one extra Bhatura, along with four teas and a bottle of water, costing around INR 1500. It‚Äôs advisable to keep yourself hydrated and have a proper meal before entering the security hold area to save some money.

The airport also offers a variety of shopping options, including medical shops, which are very convenient. Cleanliness is well-maintained throughout the premises, and it‚Äôs crucial for every traveler to follow the rules and regulations to keep the place clean and uphold India's high values and discipline.

For a hassle-free experience, I highly recommend using the DigiYatra app for easy check-in and security clearance. This will streamline your airport experience, making it more efficient and enjoyable.

Suggestions for Passengers:

Plan Ahead: Anticipate traffic in the drop zone and allow extra time for reaching the airport.
Stay Hydrated: Carry a water bottle to stay hydrated, especially before entering the security hold area.
Have a Meal Beforehand: Eating before security can save money and time, as food options may be pricier beyond that point.
Use DigiYatra App: Utilize the app for smoother check-in and security clearance processes.
Follow Rules and Maintain Cleanliness: Respect airport guidelines and help maintain the cleanliness of the facilities.
Shopping and Medical Needs: Take advantage of the various shopping options and medical shops available at the airport.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMi1YOGZBEAE,Hazrat Nizamuddin,4,MAG MAG,"Many thanks to Hon'l Rail minister Shri Ashwini Vaishnov Sir. We Indians are really lucky to have you as our Railway Minister. It's not easy to manage such a 2nd largest rail network in India being so many regional,  natural and geographical differences. Cleanliness on stations and inside trains are clearly visible.
Some of Suggestions being regular traveller across India using railways are
1) Railway staff must be in proper and allotted dres code on duty
2) To improve cleanliness more 40% dustbins are required to install in and outside of the stations.
3) strict action and Fine to be imposed on those who are not serious about cleanliness and throwing garbage, plastic, papers, leftover food, paper cups, old cloths and Spurs, spitting here and there , should be penalised with heavy fine/3months imprisonment.
4) need more Orderly directives boards with cause and penalties to be displayed in /out stations
5) auto rikshaw/Taxi owners should be strictly not allowed to enter stations. At Nizamuddin , Mumbai, Pune, Waranasi, ludhiyana, Bangalore and many more stations I have seen them reach the station inside up to your compartment and stand in front of you, even one can't safely get down. And they are always in a gang.
6) Within station premises strict traffic rules are to be followed and permitted. And IRCTC should start reasonable prepaid On/offline vehicle booking services and proper lanes are to me maintained with co-operation of Local city traffic police dept.
7) inside trains only IRCTC permitted and pantry hawkers to be allowed. Outside hawkers /Sellers are strictly not allowed . Strict action to be taken in case , if found. Also start the billing system on IRCTC fixed prices for sufficient quantity food and beverages. This is to avoid unfair prices and cheating with travellers. Either day 1000's of such incidents and complaints are coming up for the same.
8) IRCTC Should start small movable Cart services like inside aeroplanes for serving food and beverages through trained Staff at least in AC  2,3,1st class compartments (A, B, H)
9) Any kind of religious activities on stations like Namaz, Puja, Group singing/Dancing, Shouting in a group Should be strictly prohibited and either arrested or penalised heavily. Or at least should not be allowed to board for the purchased ticket on a particular train. No refund to be given. This is to be displayed In/Outside each station at a visible place and should run on a digital display board for awareness and stopping of sic activities.
10) At Nizamuddin station -A high tower (90-100) 'to be raised displaying the station Name to identify the station for new passengers from long distance.
11) All the encroachments to be removed ASAP from all the stations (1-8) and from  Railway land nd premises a. D entry to be prohibited strictly.

Thanks

Known for its accessibility and strategic location near important landmarks like India Gate and Connaught Place, the station handles a high volume of passengers daily. It has a well-structured layout with separate arrival and departure platforms to streamline passenger movement, along with facilities like waiting rooms, food stalls, and a prepaid taxi service, which are useful for travelers.

However, the station has several shortcomings. Overcrowding, especially during peak hours, can lead to congested platforms and waiting areas, affecting overall comfort. Despite attempts to maintain cleanliness, the station often struggles with waste management, particularly in high-traffic zones. Security can also be a concern due to the sheer number of passengers, with instances of petty thefts reported periodically.

The station‚Äôs connectivity to the Delhi Metro and local transportation options, such as auto-rickshaws and buses, adds to its convenience but also contributes to traffic and congestion outside the premises. While recent upgrades, such as escalators and better signage, have improved navigation within the station, there is room for enhanced cleanliness, crowd control, and security measures.

The terminal is well-connected and provides an essential link for long-distance travel, making it a popular stop for inter-state buses.

The facility itself is quite spacious, with multiple platforms to accommodate a large number of buses. The terminal is equipped with basic amenities, including waiting areas, food stalls, and ticket counters, though the infrastructure might feel a bit dated in comparison to newer terminals. While cleanliness and maintenance are generally acceptable, some areas may feel overcrowded, especially during peak travel times.

One of the key strengths of Kashmiri Gate ISBT is its strategic location. Situated close to several metro stations and easily accessible from key parts of the city, it offers convenience for both arriving and departing passengers. Additionally, the nearby Kashmiri Gate area has a range of local shops, eateries, and services for travelers to make use of.

However, the terminal can sometimes feel chaotic due to the high volume of travelers. The rush and lack of clear signage can make navigation tricky for first-time visitors. Improved signage, seating, and general upkeep could elevate the overall experience.

Overall, Kashmiri Gate ISBT serves its purpose as a vital transport link, though it could benefit from some modern upgrades to enhance passenger comfort and streamline the travel experience.",3 months ago

Old Delhi Railway Station, while rich in historical significance and serving as a crucial transport hub, urgently needs serious attention in terms of maintenance, management, and overall regulation. The infrastructure feels outdated, and the lack of proper organization often results in chaotic scenes, especially during peak hours.

One of the biggest concerns is the cleanliness of the premises. Despite numerous signboards and announcements, many commuters continue to ignore basic hygiene practices. Littering is a common sight, and the platforms often appear neglected. Strict enforcement of cleanliness guidelines is the need of the hour.

Equally important is the role of travelers and daily commuters. Basic public ethics must be followed‚Äîusing dustbins, avoiding spitting, and keeping the area tidy are small steps that can collectively make a big difference. Without public cooperation and responsible behavior, no amount of cleaning or regulation can bring lasting change.

In conclusion, Old Delhi Railway Station holds immense potential but requires immediate intervention through strict management, improved facilities, and responsible commuting practices to restore its dignity and make it a better experience for all.",3 weeks ago

As a frequent traveler, my experiences at this station have been a mix of convenience and challenges.

One of the standout features of Sarai Rohilla is its strategic location, providing easy access to various parts of Delhi. The station is well-connected by road, and the nearby metro station enhances its accessibility, making it a preferred choice for many commuters.

The station itself boasts a distinctive architectural style, blending modern elements with a touch of tradition. The well-maintained platforms and waiting areas contribute to a clean and organized environment.

The staff is courteous and helpful, contributing to a positive overall experience. The waiting lounges are adequately equipped with seating arrangements and facilities, providing a comfortable space for passengers to wait for their trains.

One area that could see improvement is the cleanliness of certain sections of the station. While the main platforms are well-maintained, some lesser-trafficked areas may require more attention in terms of cleanliness and hygiene.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2bDlfbVBnEAE,Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium,5,Akash Markad,"Guys this is basically a spherical theatre. I haven't been to such a place before. They play a space information documentary for about 45 minutes. Very cool place and one of a kind experience. The images of interactive things are from the outside and not the main attraction.

Please keep in mind this has slots for English and Kannada. Please book tickets in advance if possible. The 75 rs ticket is primarily for the theatre.

The documentary briefly covers the growth in knowledge about space from geocentric theory to theory of relativity, gravitation lensing, red shift and blue shift. If you've completed 10+2 with PCM you won't get any new information. However, the experience is truly worth it.

Feedback for owners: the documentary is kind of old and the editing is outdated. Please modernize it. It would be awesome.

Cool place for kids and adults.

The whole vibe is very zen ‚Äî perfect if you're into spirituality, mindful living, or just trying to be more present and connected with yourself and your surroundings. Like, if you're in your healing era or just need to escape the chaos, this is a solid reset.

The main pyramid is HUGE and lowkey magical. Not even kidding ‚Äî you can literally feel the energy shift the moment you walk in. It‚Äôs quiet, still, and just makes you want to sit down and breathe. Super powerful experience, especially if you're into meditation or want to give it a try.

The place is surrounded by greenery, tall trees, and there‚Äôs even a little lake. They have other fun stuff too like paddling, archery, and off-road biking, so it‚Äôs not just all spiritual and serious ‚Äî you can chill and have fun too. Total balance.

They also run meditation sessions all day long, from sunrise to sunset, and they‚Äôre actually so calming. You can do guided meditations, join their programs, or just sit alone and vibe ‚Äî no pressure at all. It‚Äôs also spiritual in a very open, non-religious kind of way, which is honestly refreshing.

Bonus points: there's no entry fee (just pay for parking), and they even serve free lunch, which is such a sweet gesture. There are also cafes and canteens if you wanna buy snacks or coffee. You can either stay the day or book a stay for a few days if you really wanna dive in deep.

The church is built in Gothic Style Architecture with Towering spires, arched windows, large pillars and intricate stained glass artwork

Basilica houses a 6 foot tall statue of Mother Mary.  Statue is dressed in a Saree to symbolise the cultural blend of Christian and Indian traditions.

This church is elevated to Minor Basilica status in 1974 by Pope Paul VI and the first one in Karnataka.

St. Mary‚Äôs feast is celebrated in September which attracts thousands of devotees across India.

The premises houses, an adoration chapel, reconciliation centre, religious articles shop, parish priest‚Äôs office/residence and a marriage hall beside a flag mast and a row of statues of saints.

There‚Äôs very little to no parking space available, need to park on the Shivaji Nagar bus stand side or near Russel market. All roads leading to church are congested, occupied by road side vendors selling all sorts of things. Constant horn sounds and tourists chatting makes the place noisy.

On the blessed evening of Hanuman Jayanti 2025, I had the divine fortune of visiting the Ragigudda Prasanna Anjaneya Swamy Temple in Bengaluru ‚Äî and what an unforgettable spiritual journey it was!

As the sun dipped and the temple lights began to glow, the entire atmosphere turned ethereal. The vibrant chants of Hanuman Chalisa, the calm yet charged energy of devotees, and the gentle breeze carrying the scent of incense and flowers created a sacred aura that touched the soul deeply.

The temple premises were immaculately managed, with a well-maintained queue system that allowed all devotees to have a peaceful darshan of Lord Hanuman, who stood tall and mighty in his full divine glory. There was a sense of joyful discipline ‚Äî everyone smiling, sharing a common reverence, and waiting their turn with devotion in their hearts.

The prasadam ‚Äî simple yet filled with grace ‚Äî was shared lovingly, and each bite felt like a blessing.

But what truly elevated the experience to a celestial plane was the spectacular Hanuman Dhara waterfall ‚Äî flowing gloriously, illuminated and glistening like a spiritual cascade straight from the heavens. Watching it, surrounded by chants and the temple bells ringing in rhythm, gave me goosebumps. It was not just a sight, but a feeling ‚Äî of being closer to the divine.

On this Hanuman Jayanti, the Ragigudda Temple didn't just host a celebration ‚Äî it gifted a divine experience. I walked out feeling light, blessed, and deeply connected to the divine strength of Lord Hanuman.

Jai Bajrangbali! Jai Ragigudda Anjaneya!

Ragigudda Sri Prasanna Anjaneya Temple Review

Nestled on a small hillock in the heart of Jayanagar, Bengaluru, the Ragigudda Sri Prasanna Anjaneya Temple is a peaceful and spiritually uplifting destination. Dedicated to Lord Hanuman (Anjaneya), this temple is not only a place of devotion but also a spot of quiet reflection amid the bustle of the city.

The temple's elevated location provides a great view of the surrounding neighborhood, and climbing the well-maintained steps to reach the sanctum adds to the spiritual experience. The main deity, Lord Hanuman, is powerful and beautifully adorned, inspiring devotion and reverence. The temple complex also houses shrines dedicated to Lord Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and other deities, adding to the sense of completeness for devotees.

One of the highlights is the massive monolithic idols of Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheshwara, which are carved into a single rock and are truly awe-inspiring. The entire premises are clean, well-managed, and have a calming atmosphere thanks to the greenery and open spaces.

Saturdays, Hanuman Jayanti, and other festival days draw large crowds, and the energy is truly electric during these times. The temple trust also engages in community service and maintains a cultural hall where spiritual discourses and events are held.

Pros:

Clean, serene environment

Stunning rock carvings and idol architecture

Excellent maintenance

Easily accessible within the city

Can get crowded on weekends and festival days

Limited parking during peak hours

Ragigudda is more than just a temple ‚Äî it‚Äôs a blend of devotion, heritage, and calm. Whether you‚Äôre a spiritual seeker or simply someone looking for a peaceful retreat, this temple is definitely worth a visit.

I recently had the privilege of attending the Shri Yantra and Chakraraj Pooja at the magnificent Shree Parshwa Susheel Dhaam Shwetamber Jain Temple, located in Attibele, Bengaluru. This temple is a true architectural marvel, constructed entirely from pristine white marble, and exudes an aura of tranquility and devotion.

From the moment I stepped onto the temple grounds, I was enveloped in a sense of peace and spiritual calm. The intricate carvings and the serene environment provided the perfect setting for introspection and prayer. The temple is dedicated to Shankeshwar Parshwanath and also houses idols of Ghantakarna Mahaveer, Padmavati Mata, and Nakoda Bhairav, each radiating divine energy .

The temple complex is thoughtfully designed, featuring a Dharamshala for pilgrims, a Bhojanshala offering pure vegetarian meals, and a playground for children, making it a holistic spiritual retreat for families .

Participating in the pooja amidst such a serene and sacred environment was a truly uplifting experience. The meticulous organization and the devotion of the temple staff added to the sanctity of the event. I left the temple feeling rejuvenated and spiritually enriched.

I highly recommend visiting Shree Parshwa Susheel Dhaam to anyone seeking a peaceful and divine experience. It‚Äôs not just a temple; it‚Äôs a sanctuary for the soul.

The park houses a wide variety of animals including lions, tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, wild dogs, hyenas, elephants, deer, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles, monkeys, tortoises, squirrels, snakes, and other reptiles. It‚Äôs a treat for wildlife enthusiasts and families alike.

There are fences and pathways now for better protection of the tree. There is one part where you can actually touch the tree and you'll find a lot of squirrels There. It was amazing and it is quite difficult to find out the starting point of the tree. Overall, it was a really nice place to spend an hour.

Somehow after many years i visited this place not to find it as charming as it used to be. The park has definitely been renovated with a walk path but it just lacks the original charm. So painful to see that the main root of the tree was infected and succumbed due to natural causes. But for local people who have seen this tree many many years ago it will be a pain to see this tree in this state.

I'm glad that we have something left of this huge tree.

Please be mindful of the mode of transport. As long as you have your own transport or bus no issues but if you rely on cab it's a problem as you wouldn't find any at all. After waiting  for 90 min  I  took a bus.

From thrilling rides to relaxing water attractions, this park delivered a perfect mix of adventure and fun, making it an ideal spot for thrill-seekers and families alike.
The park‚Äôs adrenaline-pumping rides were the highlight of my visit.
The Cornato had my heart racing and favorites. Each ride felt safe yet thrilling, thanks to attentive staff and well-maintained equipment.

Refreshing Variety for All Ages
Beyond the thrill rides, the park boasts a great selection of water attractions. The lazy river was perfect for unwinding, and the wave pool created a beach-like vibe with its gentle swells. Kids loved the interactive splash zones and smaller slides, ensuring everyone in the family had something to enjoy.

Clean  Park
The park was impressively clean, with ample changing rooms and shaded seating areas. Food options ranged from quick snacks like fries and ice cream to hearty meals, though prices were a little high with Fast track high but it's worth it.

With its mix of daring rides, family-friendly attractions, and top-notch facilities, it's a summer must-visit. Whether you‚Äôre chasing thrills or just want to cool off, this spot guarantees a memorable day out. Don‚Äôt forget sunscreen and a sense of adventure!",a month ago

Water rides tend to attract more crowd, especially in summer, as everyone prefers to cool off. There are plenty of food stalls, including pure vegetarian options.

Entry is free, making it accessible to all, but unfortunately, it lacks proper management and upkeep. Unlike other monuments, there are no officials to oversee its condition.

The water inside the well is stagnant, blackened, and emits a pungent smell that isn't noticeable from a distance but becomes apparent when you're closer. Flies and mosquitoes hover around, making it clear that maintenance is needed. The monument itself has a unique charm, and the steep steps add to its historical feel, but some restoration and basic facilities would greatly enhance the experience.

There are very limited to no food options nearby, which might be inconvenient for visitors. Despite its condition, it remains popular, especially among foreign tourists. With better maintenance, this place could become a much better attraction, deserving of a higher rating.

Of these, the observatory at Mathura and the fort that protected it were destroyed before 1857.[4]
As part of Jantar Mantar there were many instruments like Samrat Yantra, Jai Prakash Yantra, Disha Yantra, Rama Yantra, Chakra Yantra, Rashiwalya Yantra, Dingash Yantra and Utaansh Yantra. The primary purpose of the instruments was to compile astronomical tables and to predict the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvbnEteHlnRRAB,"Safdarjung Tomb, Delhi",4,Rakesh Kumar Singh,"It was built in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style for Nawab Safdarjung. The monument has an ambience of spaciousness and an imposing presence with its domed and arched red, brown and white coloured structures. Safdarjung, Nawab of Awadh, was made prime minister of the Mughal Empire (Wazir ul-Mamlak-i-Hindustan) when Ahmed Shah Bahadur ascended the throne in 1748.The tomb is located near the Safdarjung Airport at the T junction of Lodi Road and Aurobindo Marg (earlier name Mehrauli Road) in New Delhi.
Safdar Jang, born Mirza Muqim Abul Mansur Khan, was the second Nawab of Awadh and one of the most powerful nobles during the declining years of the Mughal Empire. Following the death of Emperor Muhammad Shah in 1748, he moved to Delhi. Under the newly crowned Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur, Safdar Jang was appointed as the Prime Minister (Wazir) with the title Vazir ul-Mamalk-i-Hindustan when the Mughal Empire's influence had dwindled to only parts of northern India.

As Wazir, Safdar Jang effectively wielded considerable power, reducing the emperor to a mere figurehead. His dominance and authoritarian approach, however, earned him strong opposition from rival nobles, including Imad-ul-Mulk and Najib-ud-Daulah, who led a faction against him. Contrary to popular belief, the Marathas were not directly involved in his ousting. After a series of battles, Safdar Jang was forced to leave Delhi in 1753 due to mounting opposition, returning to Awadh where he died in 1754.

Following his death his son Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula sought permission from the Mughal emperor to construct a tomb for his father in Delhi. The tomb, designed by an Abyssinian architect named Bilal Muhammad Khan, was built at a cost of approximately three lakh rupees and remains a significant example of late Mughal architecture.

To the south of this tomb is the historic site of the battle that was fought in 1386 between Timur of Mangol and Sultan Mahmud Khan of the Tughluq dynasty when the latter was defeated.
It needs regular proper maintenance-ASI should look into it without bias.

The complex traces its origins to the 13th century during the reign of Alauddin Khilji. The term ‚ÄòHauz Khas‚Äô translates to ‚ÄòRoyal Tank‚Äô in Persian, referring to the large water reservoir built to supply water to the city of Siri. Later, Firoz Shah Tughlaq restored the tank and added significant structures, including a madrasa (Islamic seminary), mosque, and his own tomb .

You can easily spend more than half a day exploring the different structures, and some areas make great spots for photos. The history is evident here in the madrasa and Firoz Shah‚Äôs tomb.

The serene Hauz Khas lake serves as a wonderful accompaniment to the complex. The complex is open everyday from 10:30am to 7pm.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3aDZQNU93EAE,Hauz Khas Village complex (Deer park),5,Indranil Bhattacharjee,"Hauz Khas Complex, located in South Delhi, India, is a historic site renowned for its architectural significance and vibrant surroundings.

History: The name ""Hauz Khas"" is derived from Persian, where 'Hauz' means ""water tank"" and 'Khas' denotes ""royal,"" translating to ""Royal Tank."" This reservoir was originally constructed by Alauddin Khilji during his reign from 1296 to 1316 to supply water to the inhabitants of Siri, the second city of Delhi. Later, during Firuz Shah Tughlaq's rule (1351‚Äì1388), the tank was desilted, and several significant structures were added around it, including a madrasa (Islamic seminary), a mosque, and Firuz Shah's own tomb. These additions transformed the area into a prominent center for Islamic education and architecture. 

Monuments and Structures: The complex houses several notable structures:

Madrasa: An Islamic learning center established by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, showcasing Indo-Islamic architectural styles.

Mosque: A place of worship adjacent to the madrasa, reflecting the architectural aesthetics of the Tughlaq dynasty.

Firuz Shah's Tomb: The final resting place of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq, centrally located within the complex.

Pavilions and Cenotaphs: Scattered throughout the gardens, these structures add to the historical ambiance of the site.

Chor Minar: Known as the ""Tower of Thieves,"" historically believed to have displayed the heads of executed thieves as a deterrent during the Khilji dynasty. 

Visiting Hours: The Hauz Khas Complex is open daily from 10:30 AM to 7:00 PM. It is advisable to visit during early morning or late afternoon hours to avoid the midday heat and to experience the site in pleasant lighting conditions. 

Facilities: Adjacent to the complex is the Deer Park, a well-maintained green space home to spotted deer, peacocks, rabbits, and various bird species. The park offers walking trails, a rose garden, and a duck pond, providing a serene environment for relaxation. Additionally, the surrounding Hauz Khas Village has evolved into a hub for art galleries, boutiques, cafes, and restaurants, blending historical charm with contemporary culture. 

How to Reach from New Delhi Railway Station and Indira Gandhi International Airport:

From New Delhi Railway Station: Hauz Khas is approximately 12 kilometers away. You can take the Yellow Line of the Delhi Metro from New Delhi Station to Hauz Khas Metro Station. Alternatively, taxis and auto-rickshaws are readily available.

From Indira Gandhi International Airport: The complex is about 16 kilometers from the airport. Travelers can use app-based cab services or airport taxis for a direct journey. For a more economical option, take the Airport Express Line to New Delhi Metro Station, then transfer to the Yellow Line towards Hauz Khas. 

Best Season to Visit: The ideal time to explore Hauz Khas Complex is during the cooler months, from October to March. During this period, the weather is pleasant, making it comfortable to walk around and fully appreciate the historical and cultural offerings of the area. 

Hauz Khas Complex offers a unique blend of Delhi's rich historical heritage and its dynamic modern culture, making it a must-visit destination for both history enthusiasts and casual travelers.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvNnB6Qm9nRRAB,Purana Quila,5,Vikas Gupta,"The Purana Qila was built by the Mughal Emperor Humayun as a part of his new city of Dinpanah in the 16th century. One might wonder, as to what accords this particular fort the pride of place to be termed as ‚Äúthe Purana Qila‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Old Fort‚Äù, when there exist much older forts in Delhi. The answer to this question lies in an age known to us not so much through monuments and material culture, but through the kaleidoscopic world of myths and legends.

A strong local tradition believes that the area in which the Purana Qila stands today is the site of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas of the great epic Mahabharata. It is for the same reason that the Purana Qila is often called the ‚ÄúPandavon ka Qila''.

Although it‚Äôs mostly in ruins, the vast stone walls, ancient pathways, and crumbling structures give a glimpse into the past glory of this massive fort.

The area is quite expansive, so it‚Äôs best to be prepared for a bit of walking. The rugged landscape and panoramic views of the surrounding areas make it worth the effort. The fort is not overly crowded, making it a good spot for a peaceful exploration of Delhi's historical side.

If you're interested in history or architecture, Tughlakabad Fort is definitely a place to visit. However, it's a good idea to carry water and snacks, as there are limited facilities around the area. Exploring the fort gave me a deeper appreciation for Delhi's rich heritage and the stories that lie hidden in its ruins. A must-visit for history enthusiasts and those who enjoy offbeat locations away from the busy city center!

1. There's is a paid parking nearby.
2. You should get tickets from ASI website in advance. But you can also get the tickets from the counter. I have went to the place during early hours, and I didn't had to pay anything.
3. Some stairs and podium like structures are quite high so please keep your balance and don't do risky stunts and jumps.
4. You might have to walk a little, so wear comfortable clothes and good shoes.
5. Try to visit the place after rains when the sky is clear. The view of Delhi from top is mesmerizing. I went to the place when it was sunny as well as drizzle. It was pure magical.
6. Avoid during summer afternoons when the sun is on top as there's almost no shade to take cover.
7. There are no eateries or washrooms inside.
8. Please don't bring food items inside the monument. And don't litter as there are no bins inside.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJa056cWJREAE,Tughlaqabad Fort,5,Indranil Bhattacharjee,"History
Tughlaqabad Fort, in South Delhi, was founded in 1321 by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, the first Tughlaq dynasty ruler, to protect his empire from Mongol invasions. Built over four years, this massive stone fortress was abandoned by 1327 after Ghiyasuddin‚Äôs death, possibly due to water scarcity or a curse linked to saint Nizamuddin Auliya, whose tomb construction was disrupted by the fort‚Äôs demands. It briefly served as the dynasty‚Äôs third capital before being deserted.

What Can You See There
Spanning 6.5 km, the fort‚Äôs ruins include crumbling ramparts, bastions, and underground passages. Highlights are the palace remnants, a stepwell (baoli), and Ghiyasuddin‚Äôs tomb across the road, linked by a causeway. The elevated citadel offers panoramic Delhi views. Scattered stones and wild vegetation add a haunting charm, drawing history buffs and photographers.

Facilities Available
Facilities are minimal‚Äîbasic signage, a small parking area (free but limited), and no restrooms or food stalls inside. Visitors need water and sun protection, as shade is scarce. Accessibility is challenging due to uneven terrain and lack of ramps.

Timings
Open daily, 7:00 AM‚Äì5:00 PM, managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Entry may close earlier in winter or during maintenance.

Best Season to Visit
October to March offers pleasant weather (15‚Äì25¬∞C), ideal for exploring the sprawling ruins. Summers (April‚ÄìJune) hit 45¬∞C, and monsoons (July‚ÄìSeptember) make paths slippery.

Ticket Prices
‚Çπ25 (Indians), ‚Çπ300 (foreigners); free for kids under 15. Camera fees: ‚Çπ25 (still), ‚Çπ200 (video). Tickets are cash-only at the gate.

The park is super easy to get to, it's just a 10-minute walk from the Kutub Minar metro station. The trails and walkways are all really well-maintained and restored, which makes it easy to explore the entire park.

We were excited to see that they're restoring some of the monuments, and they're going to be open to the public soon.

The park is perfect for a day out with family and friends. There are fountains, mountain trails, and plenty of space for kids to run around. Plus, there are some nice resting places where you can relax and enjoy the views.

The only thing I think could be improved is the availability of drinking water facilities. There's only one restroom for the public, so that could also be increased.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting Mehrauli Archaeological Park. It's a beautiful and historic place with something for everyone.""

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNncnFYVVRBEAE,Mehrauli Archaeological Park,5,Prashant Patwa,"Mehrauli Archaeological Park is a hidden gem in Delhi, offering a fascinating mix of history, nature, and tranquility. Unlike the more crowded tourist spots, this park feels like a peaceful escape, yet it holds centuries of heritage within its ruins.

The park is home to over 100 historical monuments, including the stunning Jamali Kamali Mosque, Rajon Ki Baoli (a stepwell), and the Tomb of Balban. Walking through the ruins, you can feel the remnants of Delhi‚Äôs past empires, from the Delhi Sultanate to the Mughals. The intricate architecture and carvings, especially in Jamali Kamali, are breathtaking, though some structures could use better maintenance.

What makes this place special is the serene atmosphere. Unlike the nearby Qutub Minar, which is always packed, Mehrauli Archaeological Park offers plenty of quiet corners to explore. It‚Äôs a great spot for photography, history lovers, and morning walkers. However, signage is limited, so it‚Äôs best to do some research before visiting.

The best time to visit is early morning or late afternoon, as the park lacks shaded areas, and Delhi‚Äôs heat can be intense. Entry is free, making it a budget-friendly experience.

Overall, if you love history and exploring lesser-known places, Mehrauli Archaeological Park is a must-visit. It‚Äôs a reminder of Delhi‚Äôs layered history, just waiting to be discovered.

Tip: Wear comfortable shoes, carry water, and visit with a group if exploring late in the evening.

Dargah Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia

If you find yourself in Delhi, a visit to the Dargah Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia is an absolute must. This sacred space pulsates with an atmosphere of profound peace, prosperity, love, and happiness that is truly captivating. From the moment you step into the bustling lanes leading to the shrine, you are enveloped in a unique cultural experience that touches your soul.

The air resonates with devotional music (Qawwali), the scent of incense, and the murmur of prayers. It's a place where people from all walks of life, irrespective of their religious beliefs, come together with unwavering faith. Witnessing this unity and devotion is incredibly moving. The architecture, steeped in history, adds to the spiritual ambiance, transporting you to another time.

While the overall experience is deeply enriching, it's wise to be mindful of your surroundings. Like any popular religious site, there can be individuals who may try to exploit the faith of visitors through donation scams. It's best to be cautious and avoid engaging with anyone who approaches you with unsolicited offers for Dargah updates or requests for your personal information. Stick to official donation boxes if you wish to contribute.

Despite this minor caution, the Dargah Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia remains a powerful and uplifting experience. It's a place where you can find solace, witness the beauty of shared faith, and immerse yourself in a vibrant cultural tapestry.

His khanqah in Delhi became a symbol of love, peace, and equality, welcoming people of all faiths. He preached selflessness, unity, and devotion to God, staying away from politics despite the turbulent times. His teachings were carried forward by his beloved disciple Amir Khusrau.

He passed away in 1325, and his Dargah in Delhi remains a revered spiritual site. His life stands as a beacon of love, humility, and divine service.

The Lotus Temple is one of the most iconic and peaceful places in Delhi. Here‚Äôs a detailed review of my experience:

1. Beautiful Architecture üå∏:
Shaped like a blooming lotus, the temple‚Äôs design is absolutely stunning. It stands out as a symbol of peace and unity.

2. Feels Like a Park üå≥ü¶ã:
The surrounding lawns and gardens are lush green, well-maintained, and full of calmness. It feels more like a peaceful park than just a religious place. Perfect spot for relaxation and reflection.

3. Peaceful Vibes & Silence Inside ü§´‚ú®:
Inside the temple, complete silence is maintained, which gives a soothing spiritual experience regardless of your religion.

4. Good for Families & Solo Visits üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üë§:
Whether you're visiting with family or alone, it offers a calming experience, especially for those who enjoy nature and quietness.

5. Poor Road Conditions Outside üößüòü:
One downside is the broken roads and footpaths leading to the temple. They need urgent repair for the safety and comfort of visitors.

6. Timings Should Be Extended ‚è∞üåô:
The temple closes in the evening, but such a peaceful place should ideally be open 24x7, allowing people to visit at night when it's even more peaceful.

7. Cleanliness & Security üßπüëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:
Inside the premises, everything is very neat and secure. Guards are present and helpful.

In short, the Lotus Temple is a must-visit spot, but authorities should improve the approach roads and consider 24-hour access for a truly divine experience.

However, the experience wasn‚Äôt without its challenges. The temple was incredibly crowded, more than I had anticipated. There were throngs of visitors, both locals and tourists, all eager to step inside and witness the inner sanctum of this stunning structure. It took nearly an hour to get through the entrance, with long queues winding around the grounds. Despite the wait, there was a palpable sense of patience and respect in the air, as everyone was in awe of the temple‚Äôs beauty.

Once inside, the peacefulness of the space was undeniable. The cool, quiet interior offered a stark contrast to the bustling outside world. It was a place of reflection, and I spent some time just soaking in the tranquil atmosphere. Though crowded, the experience was still worth it, as the Lotus Temple‚Äôs design and its message of spiritual harmony left a lasting impression on me.

The divine atmosphere, the soulful recitation of Gurbani, and the sight of devotees selflessly serving in the Langar hall create a feeling of pure oneness with the Divine.

The Sarovar (holy pond) adds to the serenity, and simply sitting by its side brings a sense of inner calm and reflection. Gurudwara Bangla Sahib stands not just as a place of worship, but as a living symbol of compassion, humility, and the timeless teachings of Sikhism.

It is a place where the soul feels light, where the heart finds hope, and where faith deepens effortlessly. Truly a sanctuary of divine love and grace.

As soon as you step inside the gates, all the noise of Delhi seems to fade away and you get enveloped by a sense of calm. The golden dome of Bangla Sahib Gurudwara shines royally along with the hymns that are being sung. The kohinoor of Delhi pauses for one to take that deep breath and relax.

This place is special because of how everyone is treated equally. Everyone can enter the community kitchen and serve themselves food 24*7, there are no restrictions. Watching the hardworking volunteers tirelessly chop vegetables, cook, serve and clean is moving to say the least. Dip your feet in the sarovar and the rest of the world gets blindsided by the quiet charm of the Gurudwara.

In the night, this Gurudwara serves a different purpose. All the prayers from the bangla combined with the splashes from the sarovar can be heard clearly. The marble monument gets illuminated and the water reflects all the night lights. For hours, one can sit without overthinking and relax.

People come here for many different reasons, but everyone is bound to get at least a little bit tired. All of this Islam and serenity, along with you are bound to feel at least just a bit weary at one time, and Bangla will take care of you at that moment.

Rather, it contributes to the sensation that you are entering into something larger than yourself. Your reasons of faith, curiosity, or simply wanting to take a moment of silence will ensure you leave with its sense of calm.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvb012WVF3EAE,Tibetan Monastery (Majnu ka tila),5,Madhur Gupta,"A Day at Majnu Ka Tila ‚Äì Felt Like I Left Delhi Without Leaving

If you ever want to take a quick break from the busy life of Delhi, Majnu Ka Tila is the perfect place. The moment I reached there, I felt like I had entered a whole new world ‚Äî almost like I‚Äôd been teleported to another country.

The streets are full of color, with Tibetan flags hanging above, the smell of incense in the air, and soft chants coming from the Buddhist Monastery. It was so peaceful. I spent some quiet time inside the monastery, just looking around and feeling calm. The walls were beautifully painted, and the monks were sitting peacefully ‚Äî it really made me slow down and enjoy the moment.

After that, I decided to try some local food. I had Laphing ‚Äî it‚Äôs a cold, spicy Tibetan snack. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt like it much. Maybe because I‚Äôm not used to the texture and taste. But I‚Äôm glad I tried it! Then I had a boba tea for ‚Çπ150 ‚Äî now that was nice and refreshing.

Walking around, I noticed how different everything felt. The shops, the food, the people ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt feel like Delhi at all. It was calm, colorful, and full of culture.

How to Reach Majnu Ka Tila

By Metro:
Take the Yellow Line and get off at Vidhan Sabha Station. From there, you can walk (about 20 minutes) or take an auto for ‚Çπ30‚Äì‚Çπ50.

By Bus:
You can also take a DTC bus that stops near Majnu Ka Tila.

By Car:
It‚Äôs not the best idea to take your own car because parking can be a problem.

Timings

The market is open every day from 11 AM to 9 PM.

The monastery is best to visit between 9 AM and 6 PM.

Food I Tried

Laphing ‚Äì ‚Çπ60: Spicy and cold snack. Not my favorite, but worth trying once.

Boba Tea ‚Äì ‚Çπ150: Sweet and fun to drink, especially if you like chewy tapioca balls.

Final Thoughts

Majnu Ka Tila gave me a peaceful break from regular city life. The place is full of culture, calm vibes, and tasty food. Even if you don‚Äôt like everything you try (like I didn‚Äôt love Laphing), it‚Äôs still a really cool experience. I‚Äôll definitely go again ‚Äî maybe try something new next time!

It's a very informative place for both people and students
There are many different sections dedicated to different parts of science
like : medical science , astronomy , political science, etc.
It has displayed the artifacts very well
There are life-sized models of history and other subjects like dinosaurs , Indus Valley civilization, etc.
They have interactive models which you can try yourself. They are fun to interact with
There's a canteen also it has good food and they are at a fair price

The hygiene is also really good
Both in the structure and canteen but watch out sometimes because schools mostly have trips here, and children can create rushes that can destroy your peace

I would reduce 1 star because many of the interactive models are broken, and most of them are currently under maintenance.

Though the centre is designed for older children, the little ones were fascinated by the colorful models, moving exhibits, and interactive displays. The fun science experiments and gigantic dinosaur model were particular highlights, sparking their curiosity. The water-based activities and light & sound experiments kept them engaged.

The National Science Museum in Delhi, a haven for science enthusiasts, offers a fascinating journey through the realms of science and technology. The museum houses a vast collection of exhibits, ranging from interactive displays to historical artifacts, that cater to visitors of all ages.
One of the highlights of the museum is its interactive exhibits, which allow visitors to experiment with various scientific concepts. These hands-on experiences make learning engaging and enjoyable, particularly for children. The museum also boasts impressive displays on topics such as energy, space exploration, and the human body.
However, while the museum offers a wealth of knowledge and entertainment, there's room for improvement. Some of the exhibits could benefit from modernization to keep pace with the latest advancements in science and technology. Additionally, the maintenance of certain areas, such as the washrooms, could be enhanced to provide a more comfortable visitor experience.
Despite these minor shortcomings, the National Science Museum remains a valuable resource for education and inspiration. It is a place where visitors can ignite their curiosity, expand their knowledge, and appreciate the wonders of science. With a few upgrades and improvements, the museum can continue to be a leading science center in India and a must-visit destination for both locals and tourists.

Visiting the Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum in Delhi is like stepping into a time capsule of India's political history. The museum, once the residence of India's first female Prime Minister, offers a deep insight into Indira Gandhi‚Äôs personal and political journey.

One of the most fascinating aspects of the museum is how it preserves her family life and childhood memories. From photographs of her early years to glimpses of her living quarters and study room, every corner narrates a story. The study room, filled with books and personal belongings, showcases her intellectual depth and love for literature. Her collection of books on history, politics, and global affairs reflects her visionary leadership.

The museum also highlights her contributions to India, from the Green Revolution to her role in shaping modern India‚Äôs foreign policies. Rare photographs and letters give a personal touch to her journey, making visitors appreciate her dedication to the nation.

The most emotional part of the museum is the preserved path where she took her last steps before her tragic assassination. The glass-encased bloodstains serve as a stark reminder of her sacrifice for the country.

Overall, the Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum is a must-visit for history lovers and those who wish to understand the life of one of India‚Äôs most powerful leaders. It‚Äôs not just a museum; it‚Äôs an experience that leaves you inspired.

The museum, once her residence, is a poignant tribute to her life and legacy. As I walked through the rooms, I could feel the weight of history in every corner, from the photographs capturing her political journey to the personal artifacts that revealed the woman behind the leader.

The most moving part of the visit was the room where she was assassinated. The floor is marked with footprints where she fell, a somber reminder of the tragic end to her life. It gave the museum an emotional depth that I wasn‚Äôt expecting, making her story feel even more immediate and human.

The rest of the museum showcases her achievements, her family life, and the era in which she led India. What I found particularly striking was the contrast between her public and private personas‚Äîhow her personal life, full of family photos and everyday objects, stood alongside her powerful political legacy.

While the museum wasn‚Äôt overly crowded, there was a quiet reverence in the air, and I took my time to absorb everything. It wasn‚Äôt just a visit to a museum, but a journey through India‚Äôs modern history, told through the life of one of its most influential figures.

The museum is filled with a variety of optical illusions, mind-bending exhibits, and interactive installations that are designed to trick your eyes and challenge your perception. It‚Äôs a great place if you‚Äôre looking for something different from the usual museums or outings in Delhi.

The entire space is well-maintained, clean, and visually engaging. The exhibits are creative and photogenic ‚Äî perfect for taking quirky pictures and videos, especially if you‚Äôre visiting with friends, family, or kids. In fact, the kids in our group had a fantastic time, running around and interacting with the displays. Their excitement alone made the visit worthwhile.

One of the things to keep in mind is that it‚Äôs not a very large place. You can comfortably explore the whole museum within an hour. So while the experience is definitely fun and memorable, the duration feels a bit short, especially considering the ticket price. It‚Äôs slightly on the expensive side for the time you spend inside, but if you‚Äôre visiting as a group or family, it feels more justified because everyone can participate and enjoy.

A special mention to the staff ‚Äî they were extremely supportive and polite throughout. They patiently explained how each illusion works and also helped us take good photos at certain exhibits, ensuring we didn‚Äôt miss out on the best angles.

In summary, the Museum of Illusions is a unique, one-time visit spot in Delhi. It may feel a little costly for a short visit, but it offers a fresh, engaging experience that‚Äôs especially enjoyable for kids and those who love interactive activities. Definitely recommended for a fun outing, though it might not be something you‚Äôd return to repeatedly.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJcVlxNTd3RRAB,National Zoological Park,4,Prabjeet Singh,"The National Zoological Park in Delhi is a great place to visit, especially for nature and wildlife lovers. The zoo is well-maintained, and the variety of animals, including tigers, lions, elephants, and exotic birds, makes it an exciting experience for both kids and adults. The enclosures are spacious, and the greenery adds to the pleasant atmosphere.

However, a few things could be improved. Some areas lack proper signboards, making navigation a bit tricky. Additionally, during peak hours, it can get quite crowded, and facilities like food stalls and drinking water points could be better managed.

If you‚Äôre planning to visit, I‚Äôd recommend going early in the morning or on a weekday to avoid the rush. Carrying water and wearing comfortable shoes will make the visit more enjoyable. Overall, it‚Äôs a good place for a day out with family and friends!

Located right on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, this UNESCO World Heritage site is one of the oldest structural stone temples in South India, dating back to the 8th century during the reign of the Pallava dynasty.

The temple's location is breathtaking‚Äîset against the backdrop of the endless sea, with waves crashing gently nearby. The entire area has a peaceful aura, especially during sunrise or sunset when the golden light hits the ancient stones. The architecture is impressive, with intricate carvings and a layout that reflects the brilliance of early Dravidian temple design. The main shrine is dedicated to Lord Shiva, and there's also a smaller shrine for Lord Vishnu.

Getting there was fairly easy. I drove from Chennai, which is around 60 km away, and the journey along the East Coast Road (ECR) was smooth and scenic. Public transport is also available‚Äîbuses and taxis can be hired from Chennai or nearby towns like Chengalpattu. There‚Äôs ample parking near the temple complex and local guides available if you're interested in the detailed history.

The site is well-maintained, with clean paths, manicured gardens, and signboards explaining the temple‚Äôs background. I recommend spending at least an hour or two to really soak in the vibe. Don‚Äôt forget to carry water and wear comfortable footwear‚Äîit's best explored on foot.

Overall, the Shore Temple is not just a historical monument; it‚Äôs a peaceful retreat that connects you with India‚Äôs glorious past and nature's beauty all at once. A must-visit if you're anywhere near Tamil Nadu!

You can spend a good amount of time just admiring the intricate carvings and the overall structure, imagining the history behind it.
Based on my experience, I'd strongly suggest planning your visit during the daytime. The sunlight truly brings out the details in the stonework and allows you to appreciate the craftsmanship fully. Seeing it illuminated by natural light makes a significant difference compared to dimmer conditions. It's a fascinating piece of history, and seeing the architectural details clearly is key to the experience. Definitely a worthwhile stop if you appreciate historical sites and impressive architecture!

It was constructed during the reign of Pallava King Narasimhavarman II (Rajasimha) (c. 700‚Äì728 CE).

It is part of the Mamallapuram group of monuments, which includes rock-cut caves and monolithic rathas (chariots).

Unlike earlier Pallava temples that were carved from rocks, the Shore Temple is one of the first structural temples built with granite blocks.

The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, symbolizing the fusion of Shaivism and Vaishnavism.

The larger shrine faces east so that the first rays of the sun illuminate Lord Shiva‚Äôs sanctum.

A smaller shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu in reclining form (Anantashayana) is also present.

A wall of Nandi sculptures surrounds the temple, protecting it from the sea.

European travelers in the 16th century mentioned ""Seven Pagodas"", claiming that six other temples once stood along the shore.

The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami exposed underwater structures near the temple, suggesting that remnants of ancient temples may still exist beneath the sea.

Over centuries, the temple suffered erosion from sea winds and saltwater.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has taken measures to protect it, including building protective groynes along the coast.

It remains an important site for both history and Hindu worship.

The temple is said to have been originally built during the Pallava dynasty (7th‚Äì9th century CE).

The name ""Thiruporur"" translates to ""the holy place of battle"", referring to the battle between Lord Murugan and the demon Surapadman.

It is believed that Saint Agastya and Sage Chidambara Swamigal played a role in consecrating the temple.

The temple features a five-tiered Rajagopuram (entrance tower) and beautifully carved pillars.

Several inscriptions in Tamil and Grantha scripts from the Pallava and Vijayanagara periods describe land grants, temple donations, and religious rituals.

It is one of the 33 major Murugan temples in Tamil Nadu.

Devotees believe that worshipping Murugan here removes obstacles and grants success in life.

The temple is built on the traditional lines of south Indian temples. The Rajagopuram at the entrance has several stuccos with the legends of the Skanda Purana depicted on them. The Moolavar (main deity) resembles the Palani temple idol and is in standing position.
The temple courtyard houses several Sannidhis including that of Varasiddhi Vinayaka, Chokkanathar, Meenakshi Amman, Kali, Bhairava, Shanmuga with Valli and Deivanai. In the inner Praharam one can see the niches of Dakshinamurthy, Chandikeshwar, and Mahalakshmi. There is a separate shrine for Angaaran (Mars)

The belief is very strong here that people who cannot undertake the pilgrimage to the Palani temple can visit the Vadapalani temple with their offerings.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2cUppM01REAE,Kandhakottam Temple,5,Chandru,"Arulmigu Sri Muthu Kumara Swamy Devasthanam is a prominent Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Murugan, situated in the George Town area of Chennai.

The temple's origins trace back to the 17th century, with its establishment attributed to two devout individuals, Maari Chettiar and Kandappa Achari. During one of their pilgrimages to the Thiruporur Kandaswamy Temple, they discovered an idol of Lord Murugan beneath a peepal tree near a tank, believed to be revealed to them in a divine vision. This idol was subsequently installed in the current location, which was part of Muthiyalu Naicken's garden. The temple was constructed with significant contributions from Maari Chettiar, who is said to have sold his wife's jewelry to fund the construction.

The original structure, built in the 1670s, underwent reconstruction in the early 1800s using stone, enhancing its architectural grandeur. The temple complex spans approximately eight acres and features the 'Saravana Poigai' temple tank and the 'Magizham' tree as its sacred elements.

Kandhakottam Temple holds historical significance due to its association with Saint Ramalinga Swamigal, also known as Vallalar. As a child residing near the temple, he frequently visited and composed the devotional hymn 'Deiva Mani Malai' in praise of Lord Murugan at the age of nine. The temple also honors other saints, including Pamban Swamigal and Thiruporur Chidambara Swamigal, with dedicated shrines within its premises.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcXEtVHNBRRAB,Walajah Big Mosque,5,wasim akram,"Triplicane Big Mosque (also called Wallajah Mosque) is a mosque located in Triplicane High Road, Triplicane in Chennai. Constructed in the Mughal architectural style, the mosque was built in 1795 by the family of Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot during 1765. It has a large prayer hall, a tank and a large ground in front. The entire structure is constructed with granite without the use of iron or wood.

The Nawab of Arcot was a loyal ally of the British who offered him Chepauk Palace where he could house his military and administrative buildings. It is believed that Nawab Muhammad Ali moved to Chepauk, located in Triplicane in 1768. There were around 20,000 Marakayar Muslims who moved with him to the city. It was then the largest community of Muslims in South India after Hyderabad. The Nawab had full control of the region and all the cases were resolved under Muslim Law irrespective of the religion of the accused. Historians believe that after the mosque was built, it added to the cultural mix in Triplicane, which had a famous Hindu temple in Parthasarathy Temple and the Portuguese Christian stronghold of San Thome.

The Nawab of Arcot was friendly towards fellow Hindus, appointing a Hindu as his chief personal secretary. A chronogram written in Persian by Raja Makhhan Lal Bahdur Khirat, the Hindu Munshi of the Nawab, is found on the entrance to the prayer hall. The mosque is the largest and one of the oldest in Chennai and is active as a place of worship. It is administered by Prince of Arcot Endowments Trust. Most of the administrative staff of the mosque are Hindus, symbolizing peaceful coexistence between the two religions.",3 years ago

The temple holds historical and spiritual significance, with its old yet well-maintained structure reflecting a deep sense of tradition.

Parking & Accessibility

Anticipating a potential parking issue, I arrived at 3:45 PM, about 15 minutes before the temple's opening time of 4:00 PM. This gave me ample time to find a suitable parking space. Fortunately, the temple provides plenty of paid parking, making it convenient for visitors. Additionally, it is well-equipped to accommodate differently-abled individuals, ensuring easy access to the premises.

Temple Experience

The temple doors officially opened at 4:10 PM. Since it was not a particularly auspicious day, the crowd was moderate, allowing for a peaceful visit without long wait times. The entire temple can be covered in about 30 to 45 minutes, making it an ideal visit for those with a tight schedule.

Prasadam

Before leaving, I had the opportunity to purchase prasadam. The offerings were fresh, delicious, and available at a reasonable price, adding a sweet touch to the spiritual experience.

Overall, my visit was smooth and fulfilling. With proper planning, parking is hassle-free, and the serene atmosphere allows for a meaningful darshan. I would recommend visiting on non-peak days for a relaxed experience.

But I went in the evening. There was not that much crowded on the day. I went. It‚Äôs December 1 week.

But the only problem I faced is taking the car from Avenue Mall I took car from there and the road was so squeezed. There was no space to go. I managed to come to the church.

But I had a very good experience. It was very old church. Still they are well. Maintained  it very tidy and there was some procession. They decorated with flowers. It was so insane.

Definitely I will visit next time to this church with family such a

On the date, I went, there was no parking inside because of feast. I believe that there will be enough parking space in normal days. I have to park outside that means in the road side. It was bit risky on that day, but worth visiting to this church.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvNmVpbmtnRRAB,Marina Beach,5,Bal Bijay Gopal,"Marina Beach, or simply the Marina, is a natural urban beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, along the Bay of Bengal. The beach runs from near Fort St. George in the north to Foreshore Estate in the south, a distance of 6.0 km (3.7 mi), making it the second longest urban beach in the world, after Cox's Bazar Beach.[citation needed] It is a prominent landmark in Chennai.

The Marina beach was famed for its pristine beauty, jolly ambiance, and rich ecosystems. However, since the middle of the 20th century, the beach and water have become polluted. Proliferation of plastic bags, human waste, and other pollutants have rendered many parts of the beach unusable. In recent years, many voluntary organizations have taken up the task of cleaning up the Marina and protecting the ecosystem. Particular efforts include protection of olive ridley turtle nests along the Neelankarai section of the beach.

Flora and fauna

Marina Beach lies on the stretch of coast where olive ridley sea turtles, a species classified as Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (critically endangered), nest during mating season, chiefly between late October and April peaking from mid-January to mid-February. The Ennore‚ÄìMamallapuram zone, on which the beach lies, is one of the three major nesting grounds on the Indian coast. However, with the expansion of the shrimp trawling fishery in the eastern coast of India in the mid-1970s, several individuals of the species are washed ashore dead every year. The eggs laid by the females along the beach are also sold in the local market by the fishermen and traders. In 1977, a recovery program was started by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. Many volunteer organizations in the city, such as the Students' Sea Turtle Conservation Network and the Sea Turtle Protection Force of the TREE Foundation, get involved in conservation of the species along the coast.",6 days ago

The Annie Besant Theosophical Society headquarters is located along the beach and the road, which is why there are peaceful and old large trees.

As for the beach, the vibe is great and enjoyable. However, if you want a relaxing and peaceful beach, this is not the place for you. It's crowded. The only downside is that since the beach is located far from city areas like Anna Nagar, Koyambedu, and Vadapalani, you may face transportation problems, and the auto drivers here are quite rude and demanding. As it gets dark, the place becomes dangerous; there is no transportation available, and I recommend leaving the area before dark if you do not have your own transport.",2 months ago

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvN09USGxnRRAB,Arignar Anna Zoological Park,5,MADHES WARAN,"Had a good time visiting the Anna Geology Museum and Vandalur Zoo last Sunday. It's a great place for families and kids to explore and learn about wildlife and geology. The overall experience was enjoyable, and the place is well-maintained.

However, since April is quite hot, the walking paths get really exhausting due to the high temperatures. It would be great if more trees and shaded plant areas are added along the way to give some relief from the sun.

One concern I noticed was a deer that had escaped its enclosure and was eating human-discarded food. While it was surprising to see, it also shows the need for better monitoring and care in the deer section to avoid any risks to the animals or visitors.

On the positive side, they support both cash and QR code payments, which is very convenient in this digital age. But one important suggestion: there was no clear notice or signage informing visitors that online payment can be done directly through a QR code without standing in the ticket queue. I waited in a long queue only to be told at the counter to scan and book online via WhatsApp chatbot. This needs to be highlighted with proper boards at the entrance to save visitors' time.

Despite these small issues, the zoo offers a rich and diverse experience and is definitely worth visiting. A few improvements can make it even better!",a week ago
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvZ0puOEZnEAE,Arignar Anna Zoological Park,1,NASIRUL AMIN CHOUDHURY,"I had so many expectations from this Zoo but it was a total disappointment. First took 150 per person for the Battery Operated Vehicle (BOV) & the lady operating it wouldn't allow my wife or another lady seat beside her. Then she was in such a hurry & these BOV's don't stop everywhere. Then comes the issue of too few BOV or BUS that they were full by 12PM & those who purchased tickets had to wait for 1Hr+ to catch a BOV or Safari Bus. The park management can simply make the BOV hop on hop off the vehicle or increase the Vehicle Count. So, more people can be ferried & people can take time to view.
.
Most enclosures are either rusting or haven't been cleaned for months if not years as there are stains all over. There fishes, birds or animals without labels/details or there are enclosures with labels but nothing inside visible. Rusting/Dusty/Stained grills/glasses obstruct your views.
.
Entered the fish aquarium & all the tanks were dark. Never ever seen such a pathetic zoo in my whole life.
.
The Lion & Deer safari is ok though but the free roaming lion looked in poor condition. Also, most people with us couldn't see a lot of animals as they were resting & the viewing angle/area is poor. I am not in favour of disturbing the Animals but viewing angle can certainly be improved.

Finally, the lion safari  is an exciting ride through a gated forest area where you can see lions roaming freely in a semi - natural habitat. It‚Äôs a thrilling experience that offers a close-up view of these majestic animals from the safety of a vehicle.

The journey itself feels like an adventure, leading you to this peaceful bird-watching haven.

We visited in late January and spotted only 4-5 varieties of birds, so maybe the birds started returning from vacation? That said, it's a great place for kids‚Äîthey‚Äôll enjoy the walk and the little surprises nature throws at them. The sanctuary is well-maintained, with clean walkways and seating areas. There‚Äôs one watchtower and three viewpoints spread across a 1 km stretch, offering great views of the birds.

For those hoping to get a closer look, binoculars are available for rent outside the gate at ‚Çπ100 each. However, they offer about the same clarity as your own eyes‚Äîso unless you enjoy carrying extra weight for fun, you might as well skip them!

Parking is spacious, but here‚Äôs a pro tip: If you‚Äôre thrilled to find a shady spot under a tree, brace yourself. After spending 1-2 hours inside admiring the birds, you‚Äôll return to a car that looks like a modern art piece‚Äîdecorated in a variety of bird droppings. So, don‚Äôt worry about parking in the open under the sun; at least your vehicle will be safe from ""aerial attacks!""

Tickets are nominally priced and can be purchased at the entry gate. The toilets inside look clean, but there‚Äôs a catch‚Äîthey‚Äôre locked. So, if nature calls, make sure it does before you enter, or be prepared for a test of patience.

Overall, it‚Äôs a nice getaway for nature lovers, just come with realistic bird expectations, avoid shady parking spots, and maybe bring your own binoculars!",2 months ago

It's like a joggers park but surrounded by nature, a chill environment and some species of birds.

Those people who are interested in birds and have some knowledge about them will enjoy this more but everyone will enjoy the way these birds seem free and how they travel in groups, how they can flap their wings to their heart's content and we can see that there are agriculture fields right next to the sanctuary.

Just be aware of the smell. It smells awful in certain parts maybe because of the marshy area or maybe it's the smell from the birds itself. All in all just be ready for it.

Lots of parking space. You can park right near the entrance. Ticket is not too expensive. Have to pay extra for mobile camera.
The wind was pleasant but for someone like me who has a tendency to get headaches and cold it was a bit troubling.

I immediately ended up with a light fever even though I wrapped my ears with a light scarf.

They rent binoculars here, didn't try it. Will not allow food or anything disposable after use which is wrapped in plastic inside even though I could see that other guests somehow brought food and littered

If you are coming from Chennai and using Google Maps, around 3 minutes before reaching the sanctuary, you are likely to come across a mud road, where you will probably wonder if you have come on the right path or if Google bro is mistaken. You may ask a local person like we did and they will probably tell you (noticed the guy rolling his eyes) to proceed on to the left. If you do, the bad road will end in around 100 metres and you will be back on the main road.
At the gate, you will need to buy reasonably priced tickets. Cameras are priced at extra Rs 50. Binoculars may be taken for rent outside the gate for Rs.100. Having a good set of powerful binoculars is very useful in the sanctuary. There is a walk of about a kilometre during which you will see a diverse variety of flora and fauna. Although known for its migratory and resident birds, one can see stunning butterflies, bees, moths, ants and if you're lucky even snakes.

There are watch towers built along the pathway, where one can climb up and get a spectacular view of the mangroves and it's feathered residents. Some of the beautiful birds that we sighted include the painted storks, pelicans, bronze winged jacana, golden oriole, pond and grey herons, owls, egrets, cormorants and darters.
When we visited, we came across some naturalists who work with the forest officials and caretakers in spreading awareness and conducting surveys.
Once the stretch is completed, we were advised by the forest rangers to turn and return the same way. Going ahead into the forest is prohibited.
Although we visited in March and still sighted several species of birds, it is recommended to visit between November end and February and reach there as early in the day as possible.

There is supposed to be a government guest house nearby which one can stay overnight and reach the sanctuary before dawn to get maximum sightings.
Vedanthangal is the oldest wildlife sanctuary in India and it's heartwarming to see it and it's feathered inhabitants being protected and cared for by genuine people, organisations and the government.",a month ago

The place is super cramped and has extremely high density of reptiles compared to the available space. For example the salt water crocodile is in a pool smaller than its length and no companion, and no place to walk around. They take entry fee of rs.40 per adult which should mean better maintenance.

The flowers were beautiful, and the overall atmosphere was pleasant, but the crowd was quite dense, especially around the snack area. It seemed like there was a lack of management in that section, as it got chaotic and difficult to navigate.

On the positive side, the evening music was a nice touch. It created a relaxed vibe, and it was evident that many people were enjoying it, soaking in the atmosphere.

The atmosphere is calm, and it‚Äôs a nice spot for a relaxing walk or just sitting and enjoying nature.

However, during my visit, I noticed that some renovation work was going on. Because of this, many plant containers were empty, which took away a little from the overall experience. Hopefully, once the renovation is complete, the garden will look even better.

There are also some benches where you can sit and enjoy the surroundings. The place is not too crowded, which makes it a peaceful spot to spend time with family or friends. There are a few small water bodies inside, adding to the beauty of the garden.

it‚Äôs a great place for a quiet outing, especially if you love nature. I am rating it 4 stars because of the renovation work and some empty spaces, but once everything is fixed, it will be a perfect spot to visit.

As you can see in the pictures, it had right from home decor to jewellery to sarees. Do visit during noon to avoid the rush and should peacefully. I was told by them that they have the Mela very often. And stalls sometimes change but some of them are constant. Parking slots are good, and is wheelchair accessible too!",6 years ago
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRcl9YeEhBEAE,B.M. Birla Planetarium,5,Floyd Fernandes,"Visiting the Birla Planetarium and Periyar Science and Technology Centre in Chennai was a great experience. There‚Äôs a lot to see from life-size rocket models like the GSLV and BrahMos to interactive science exhibits. The 360-degree 3D sphere show was definitely a highlight really immersive and well done. I also found the weighing machine that shows your weight on different planets pretty cool.

The human evolution section with displays on early humans and Neanderthals was interesting and there were plenty of exhibits covering space chemistry and physics. The outdoor area had some dinosaur models though a few could use some maintenance. There were also some defense and technology exhibits adding to the variety. I noticed another 3D show but I didn‚Äôt have time to check it out.

Overall it‚Äôs a great place for anyone interested in space and science. Definitely worth a visit especially for students and families

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3eWYzb3dnRRAB,B.M. Birla Planetarium,5,Arun Stephen,"Birla Auditorium is a must-visit for students eager to learn about planets, their evolution, and functioning. The multilingual video screenings were informative and included a fascinating display of aeronautical and military vehicles. Children especially enjoyed the 3D show and interactive scientific games. I was impressed by the diverse range of vehicles showcased, with clear explanations and visuals from motorcycles to airplanes. The outdoor exhibit featured a train engine and a large aircraft. The auditorium also offers convenient amenities like a canteen, clean restrooms, and a children's play area. A valid entry ticket is required, and there's ample parking available.

The planetarium offers an engaging and educational journey through the cosmos with its impressive shows and state-of-the-art projection systems. . However, the seating could be more comfortable, and some exhibits seemed a bit outdated. Overall, it‚Äôs a great place for anyone interested in astronomy or looking for a fun, informative outing. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it for families and science enthusiasts!

Kids who can only understand a little bit of science would definitely enjoy and value this place and the time spent here. Else it is just a play park with broken or rusted instruments for them.

Added amenities are restrooms, snacks shop, ample parking space, minimal entry fee.

Inside the planetarium also, all the science related items kept inside the jar looks in the very bad condition. Only thing which can be enjoyed is the show . Don't miss . Wonderful experience.

Planetarium is ok, but there are some lines on the screen, which causes distraction.  3D show is below par. Maintenance is poor. Needs more proper maintenance, as some things are rusted, broken, missing .

The 3D theatre is the top interest grasper with lots of knowledge and information regarding planets. Mesmerizing visuals can  experience here.

One more eye catching instrument is Multi Planet weight Display,where we can check our weight on different planets.
